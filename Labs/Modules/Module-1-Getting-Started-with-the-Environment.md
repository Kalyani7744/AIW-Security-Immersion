# Module 1 â€“ Getting started with the Environment

## Overview

In this exercise, you will learn how to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud in your subscription

You will be performing the following activities to achieve the goal.

  - Login to Azure Portal to access your subscription
  - Upgrade your subscription to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Plan

## Exercise 1: Log in to Azure Portal

In this exercise, you will learn how to login to the Azure Portal in the labvm-xxxxxx using user credentials provided under the Environment Details to access the Azure Portal

### Instructions 

1. After the environment is provisioned successfully your browser will load up the **Lab Guide** along with a virtual machine called **labvm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**. This virtual machine will be your platform throughout the course of the workshop. In case you do not see the **labvm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** load up on the left side of the screen, navigate to the **Resources** tab on the top right of the **Lab Guide** and check the status of the virtual machine. Alternately, you can directly RDP into labvm using the credentials provided in the **Environment Details** tab.
